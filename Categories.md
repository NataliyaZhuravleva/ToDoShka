For this project I'm going to include the next categories(property 'kinds') for the requests:
show: theatres_and_entertainments
drink: bars, biergartens, pubs, restaurants
extreme entertainment: climbing, roller_coasters, other_amusement_rides
. Unfortunately, API doesn't have category for extreme entertainment to show places like Las Vegas Skydiving. May be change that.
family-style: amusement_parks, water_parks, roller_coasters, ferris_wheels, zoos, aquariums, children_museums,
