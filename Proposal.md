### <span style="color:#0ec2b8">Description</span>
ToDoShka - an application to create customized Things ToDo List based on the user interests for the user's trip.

### <span style="color:#0ec2b8">Use Case</span>
The main users are the people who are going on their trip. When you are planning your trip, you “google” Things ToDo internet pages about a particular area. However, all people are different with different interests. One person would like to go to Las Vegas for a casino and drinks. Another one would go to Las Vegas Area for rock climbing in the Red Rocks National Park. Families with kids would love to know about kid’s entertainment, like a roller coaster. ToDoSka is supposed to be the app creating customized Things ToDo List considering user’s interests and giving them a list for their personal purposes.

### <span style="color:#0ec2b8">Minimum Viable Product</span>

* _An application considers trips to Las Vegas only._
* _An application considers the following user's interests: show, drink, extreme entertainment, family-style, but gives them an opportunity to choose just one interest to create their list._
* _An application gives users the opportunity to delete some offered Things ToDo if they don't want to do something, and create their own list such as a guide for that particular trip._

### <span style="color:#0ec2b8">Tools for MVP</span>
* _JavaScript (Node JS) or Python as a backend_
* _React as a frontend_
* _VSCode_
* _FireStore(?) - database_
* _API (?) - to get data to the database from APIs_

 ### <span style="color:#0ec2b8">Additional Features</span>
* _To let users the opportunity to choose many interests (e.g. family-style and show) and combine them in the list by interest groups._
* _To expand interest list and add sport(hiking, biking, rock climbing), casino, strip bars._
* _To let the user import (save/print/send by email) their customized list for future trips._
* _To create a user profile and store their lists there._
* _Add an option to mark favorite lists in the user profile._
* _To let users the opportunity to add what transport they are going to use (car, bike, no transport) and expand (or not) the user's list based on their transport preferences. E.g. if they have a car, they could explore Las Vegas Area, not Las Vegas city only._
* _Add another city to explore._
* _To let users the opportunity to transfer their points of interest on the Google Trip Planner._

### <span style="color:#0ec2b8">Tools for Additional Features</span>
* _User Authentication_
* _User Authorization(?)_
* _API(?)_

### <span style="color:#0ec2b8">Additional Information</span>
I would be very happy if you help me with tools’s choosing and approach choosing. We are still not familiar with FireStore. Would it be a good choice? Also, I think about APIs. I didn’t research a lot, but ideally I would want to get things to do from APIs to my database and then my app will work on that data. As I understand, in that case, I need to refresh my database sometimes, but it’ll allow me to get rid of calling APIs every time user trying to create their list. Is that possible to implement? Or, may be, you know better approach? Thank you!
